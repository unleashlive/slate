## A.I. Apps Ecosystem
Unleash live’s unique AI Apps ecosystem is designed to give developers a simple framework to create upload and monetize their industry relevant AI apps.

It’s simple;
- All you need is an idea! And an understanding of the demand.
- To begin you will need to sign up to a Unleash live developer account, simply click here 
- Training models will require video footage and or images for accuracy. There are 2 ways of gaining this footage/images, either through the developer’s own resources or we can connect you with our customer base.
- Now the coding begins. Using tf object_detection framework the developer codes up the model for training - https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection
- Once the framework is developed the model is trained on the required footage and images, upon completion the graphs are frozen for deployment 
- The developer is then required to upload the num classes / pb / pbtxt into the Unleash live developer sandbox
- The code is tested against videos and images stored in our unleash live developer sandbox
- Once the required accuracy has been achieved during the testing phase the developer submits the model for approval. The submission will require an estimated price, description of the app and the problem it solves, up to 6 images of the app (for display) - see our submission form framework
- The model is then tested with our developers, amendments are requested and when it is cleared by our developers the model is published and available for purchase 

Finally improvements and updates can be regularly committed to GitHub through tensorflow/models

### What do I need to do to use the API as a developer?

### How does the business model work?
1. Unleash live displays the completed AI model on our services page under relevant industry categories for our customers to search and activate.

Our Unleash live customers pay to activate your AI model through a subscription based model, either:
- Monthly subscription
- Per job (could be gamed, just keep it running), limits of 1 hour timeout
- Per processing hour

2. Who sets the price?
The developer sets the price which is based on a base price estimated by Unleash live (based on processing cost)
- When a customer activates your model you will receive revenue based on the plan, minus a small administration fee

### How do we stimulate the ecosystem?
AI is one of the hot topics at the moment and many large businesses looking for avenues to speed up decision making and productivity. This has lead to a higher demand in the market place, which we plan to match.

We currently have many industry clients that are exploring the use of AI in the workflow and we are willing to share with developers the most requested applications for AI. We actively promote to our industry partners in the fields of safety, mining, agriculture, infrastructure and sport, to name a few.

We also encourage developers to think of practical uses for AI Apps that can speed up the flow of information to faster decision making. If you have an idea that you believe will be of importance to industry, we are more than happy to discuss the relevance to our industry partners.

### Who are the target markets for the A.I. apps?
There are a couple of markets that AI Apps have relevance, Enterprise or Business and the Professional Consumer (Prosumer). Both markets require practical AI Apps that can work with data sets to produce relevant decision making tools

Enterprise is a market in which large businesses require AI Apps that help to turn large data sets into meaningful insights on a regular basis. They need to reproduce the insights often and of the same quality. Usually this will require the use of GPUs to manage and will have a higher price attached.

Prosumers are more likely to have smaller jobs with less data sets that they perform for their customers, however, still require the reliability of producing reliable insights they can pass onto their customers. This will require a CPU and will price lower.

### What are some example good ideas?
We regularly promote and communicate new ideas and industry requirements to developer signed up on the platform. This is an important point of interaction with our developers, which we plan to expand into a blog in which we promote our developer community and their AI Apps.

- Once signed up as Unleash live developer you get access to ideas?
- Blog on the platform?
- Unleash live is the facilitator between enterprise problems and developer solutions

### What analytics / stats are you collecting?
We believe it is important for the developers to gain insights into successful AI Apps so as to learn and build relevant Apps that will sell. It is also important for the developer to understand how their apps are performing.

The data we collect is:
- Model usage (minutes / frequency)
- Industry (which industry uses it)
- Media type (video / images)
- Device/Camera location

### How much customisation of my A.I. App is possible?
We have a generic framework for apps that helps structure the deployment of new apps, however, the complexity of the app is dependant on the use and the developer’s desire. 

We also offer our customers the chance to customise apps or build new custom AI Apps for their business. Our “Custom Development” option allows us to connect the developer and the customer through a structured format (brief) in which the customer outlines the requirements and use cases for the developer to consider when building a proposal. We facilitate the development process for both the customer and the developer. 

### How can I publish a specific custom model, with a lots of specific details in code and output?
We understand the complexity of code, especially AI models. Therefore we have worked hard with our developers to create a simple process in which the developers can upload their code and test the code in our sandbox. For more information visit:
