### What are A.I. Apps?
An A.I. App is a specialised artifical intelligence powered software application designed by talented developers and stored on our cloud platform for your use. Our A.I. App Ecosystem provides you with leading industry relevant apps that you can apply to your live video streams or stored video and image to get fast, detailed insights.

Try out our A.I. Apps Ecosystem today, go to your profile page and scroll through the list.

### How can I activate new A.I. Apps?
The Unleash live A.I. Apps Ecosystem is located on the profile page within the services tab. Simply scroll through the list of A.I. Apps and choose the relevant app. 

Click on the A.I. App to open the description and read more or simply click on the activate button to activate the app. Once the app is activated it will change colour and display "activated", making it available for use on your live streams or in your library.

### How does Live streaming work?
Live streaming can be activated very easily. Each device on our platform is given a seperate stream key, which is used to connect your device to the platform through your internet provider. As soon as you "go live" your live stream will be displayed in your live page and any other places you have embedded your feed.

### How do I apply A.I. to my Live stream?
First activate a A.I. app in your profile. To apply A.I. analysis on live video streaming open the live video page. You will notice that all devices are hidden while they are inactive to reduce clutter. As soon as a device is active and streaming the live footage will appear on the page. At this point A.I. analysis can be applied by simply choosing your A.I. app from the drop down menu next to the active live stream. Within seconds the live video feed will have an A.I. analysis overlay.

To activate A.I. on your stored videos and images you will need to navigate to your library where you will find your action button on the bottom right hand corner. Simply choose the video or image/s you want to analyse, click the action button and you will find an option to 'recognise' objects. Select this option to start the A.I. analysis. After a period of time your analysis results will appear in the Solutions Analysis page.

### How do I create an orthophoto and 3D model?
Once you have your captured images in your library, simply select all the images you wish to convert into a orthophoto and click on the action button located in the bottom right hand corner. From this menu choose 'create model' and the processing will begin. The resulting orthophoto and models will be displayed in you Solutions Models page as soon as the processing has completed.

## A.I. Apps Ecosystem

Unleash live’s unique AI Apps ecosystem is designed to give developers a simple framework to create, upload and monetize your industry relevant AI apps.

It’s simple;
- All you need is an idea and an good feel for your potential customers and demand.
- To begin you will need to sign up to a Unleash live developer account, simply click here 
- Now the coding begins. Using tf object_detection framework you code the model for training - https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection
- Training your models will require sufficient video footage and/or images for accuracy. There are 2 ways of gaining this footage/images: a. either through your own resources or we can connect you with our customer base.
- Once you are happy with the model accuracy it is time to test. Your model graphs are frozen for deployment. 
- The developer is then required to upload the num classes / pb / pbtxt into the Unleash live developer sandbox
- The code is tested against videos and images stored in our Unleash live developer sandbox or other footage you may obtain
- Once the required accuracy has been achieved during the testing phase you submit the model for approval. The submission will require an estimated price, description of the app and the problem it solves, up to 6 images of the app (for display) - see our submission form framework for all the details.
- The model is then tested with our Unleash live testing team, amendments are requested and when it is cleared by our team your A.I. model is published and available for purchase by Unleash live customers.

Finally, improvements and updates can be regularly committed to our sandbox.

### What do I need to do to use the API as a developer?

### How does the business model work?

1. Unleash live displays the completed A.I. model on our Services page under relevant industry categories for our customers to search and activate.

Our Unleash live customers purchase a subscription to activate your A.I. model. Pricing may be billed per month or per A.I. processing minute.

2. Who sets the price?
You, the developer, select your retail price category. The price categoeries are set by Unleash live and account for various factors such as expected value/demand, cost to process, cost to maintain and other factors.

3. When a customer activates your model you will receive a net revenue based on the subscription retail price, minus a Unleash live management fee.

### How do we stimulate the ecosystem?

A.I. is in high demand and many large and niche businesses are looking for avenues to speed up decision making and productivity. Your A.I. apps can match this interest with high quality A.I. solutions.

Through communication such as our blog and newsletters we will be sharing with developers the most requested applications for A.I. We actively promote to our industry partners in the fields of safety, mining, agriculture, infrastructure and sport, to name a few.

We also encourage you to think of practical uses for A.I. Apps that can speed up the flow of information to faster decision making. If you have an idea that you believe will be of importance to industry, we are more than happy to discuss the relevance to our industry partners.

### Who are the target markets for the A.I. apps?

There are a couple of markets that A.I. Apps have relevance, Enterprise or Business and the Professional Consumer (Prosumer) markets. These markets require practical A.I. Apps that can work with data sets to produce relevant insights for decision making.

Enterprise is a market in which large businesses require A.I. Apps that help to turn large video and image data sets into meaningful insights on a regular basis. They need to reproduce the insights often and of the same quality.

Prosumers are more likely to have smaller jobs with less data sets that they perform for their customers, however, still require the reliability of producing reliable insights they can pass onto their customers. 

### What are some example good ideas?

We regularly promote and communicate new ideas and industry requirements to developer signed up on the platform. We plan to expand into a blog in which we promote our developer community and their AI Apps.

Once signed up as Unleash live developer you get access to latest ideas. Unleash live is committed to be a facilitator between enterprise problems and developer solutions.

### What analytics / stats are you collecting?

We believe it is important for the developers to gain insights into successful AI Apps so as to learn and build relevant Apps that will sell. It is also important for the developer to understand how their apps are performing.

The data we collect is:
- Model usage (minutes / frequency)
- Industry (which industry uses it)
- Media type (video / images)
- Device/Camera location

### How much customisation of my A.I. App is possible?

We have a standard framework for A.I. apps that helps structure the deployment of new apps. You need to provide a fronzen graph (pb) and label file (pbtxt) based on the latest tensorflow 1.4 or higher object detection framework.

We also offer our customers the chance to customise A.I. apps or build new custom AI Apps for their business. Our “Custom Development” option allows us to connect the developer and the customer through a structured brief in which the customer outlines the requirements and use cases for the developer to consider when building a proposal. We facilitate the development process for both the customer and the developer. 

### How can I publish a specific custom model, with a lots of specific details in code and output?

We understand the complexity of code, especially A.I. models. Therefore we have worked hard with our developers to create a simple process in which the developers can upload their code and test the code in our sandbox. This capability and process will expand in the coming months as we learn and iterate. For more information visit:
